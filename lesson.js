which google api will mesure the distance coverd even in a trun
You might be interested in using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. This API can help you determine the distance between multiple locations and it can also take into account real-time traffic information, so it can accurately estimate the time it would take to travel the distance even if there are turns involved in the route. The API provides the distance and estimated time of arrival for different modes of transportation, such as driving, walking, and public transit.

how can i use this in a react native expo app for a car hailing company
To use the Google Maps Distance Matrix API in a React Native Expo app for a car hailing company, you can follow these steps:

Get an API key: To use the Google Maps Distance Matrix API, you need to get an API key from the Google Cloud Console. You can follow the instructions here to obtain an API key: https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started

Install the react-native-maps library: To display a map in your React Native Expo app, you can use the react-native-maps library. You can install it using the following command:

java
Copy code
expo install react-native-maps
Import the API key and the react-native-maps library: In your React Native component, you can import the API key and the react-native-maps library as follows:
javascript
Copy code
import MapView, { Marker } from 'react-native-maps';

const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
Use the API to get the distance and time: You can use the Google Maps Distance Matrix API to get the distance and time between two locations. You can use the fetch function to make a request to the API, and parse the response to get the information you need. Here's an example:
javascript
Copy code
const origin = 'your_origin_location';
const destination = 'your_destination_location';

const API_URL = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?units=metric&origins=${origin}&destinations=${destination}&key=${API_KEY}`;

fetch(API_URL)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
    // Use the data to display the distance and time on your map
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
Note that you need to replace your_origin_location and your_destination_location with the actual locations you want to get the distance and time for.

By using the above steps, you can integrate the Google Maps Distance Matrix API into your React Native Expo app for a car hailing company and display the estimated distance and time of travel on a map.

does this solve the problem even if the car goes around a raound about
Yes, the Google Maps Distance Matrix API considers turns and roundabouts when calculating the distance and estimated time of travel. It uses real-time traffic information to accurately estimate the time it would take to travel the distance, even if there are turns or roundabouts involved in the route.

So, if a car goes around a roundabout, the API will still provide an accurate estimate of the distance and time of travel from the origin to the destination.

how can i list the plcace they have visited within 10 meter
To list the places a car has visited within a 10 meter radius, you can use the Google Places API. The Google Places API allows you to search for places based on a geographic location and a radius, and it returns information about the places found, including their name, address, and types.

Here's how you can use the Google Places API in your application:

Get an API key: To use the Google Places API, you need to get an API key from the Google Cloud Console. You can follow the instructions here to obtain an API key: https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started

Make a request to the API: You can use the fetch function to make a request to the Google Places API and retrieve information about the places within a 10 meter radius of a specific location. Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const latitude = 37.7749;
const longitude = -122.4194;
const radius = 10;

const API_URL = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location=${latitude},${longitude}&radius=${radius}&key=${API_KEY}`;

fetch(API_URL)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
    // Use the data to list the places
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
In the above example, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key, and latitude and longitude with the location you want to search places around

the car mover for 1km how to list the plcae they pass for every 10 meters
To list the places a car passes for every 10 meters as it moves along a route, you can use the Google Places API in combination with the Google Maps Directions API.

Here's how you can do it:

Get an API key: To use the Google Places API and Google Maps Directions API, you need to get an API key from the Google Cloud Console. You can follow the instructions here to obtain an API key: https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started

Make a request to the Directions API: You can use the Google Maps Directions API to get the route between two locations and the list of the latitude and longitude of each point on the route. Here's an example of how to do it using the fetch function:

javascript
Copy code
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const origin = 'San Francisco, CA';
const destination = 'Los Angeles, CA';

const API_URL = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=${origin}&destination=${destination}&key=${API_KEY}`;

fetch(API_URL)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
    // Use the data to get the list of latitude and longitude of each point on the route
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
In the above example, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key, and origin and destination with the actual locations you want to get the route between.

Make a request to the Places API: For each point on the route, you can use the Google Places API to search for places within a 10 meter radius of that location. Here's an example:
javascript
Copy code
const latitude = 37.7749;
const longitude = -122.4194;
const radius = 10;

const API_URL = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location=${latitude},${longitude}&radius=${radius}&key=${API_KEY}`;

fetch(API_URL)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
    // Use the data to list the places within a 10 meter radius of the location
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
In the above example, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key, latitude and longitude with the actual location you want to search places around, and radius with the desired search radius.

By combining the Google Maps Directions API and the Google Places API, you can list the places a car passes for every 10 meters as it moves along a route.
